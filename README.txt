---------------

The django-crazyegg application integrates Crazy Egg [1] heatmaps into a
Django [2] project.

Crazy Egg is an easy to use hosted web application that generates
heatmaps from webpage visitor clicks.  It allows you to discover the
areas of web pages that are most important to your visitors.  This
Django application is designed to make integration of Crazy Egg very
simple.  See the package docstring for documentation.  The source code
and issue tracker are hosted on Github [3].
